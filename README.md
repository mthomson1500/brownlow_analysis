This project aims to explore the relationship between player statistics and brownlow votes in the AFL. 

My hypothesis is that players with high disposal and clearance numbers will score more votes then players with high hitouts and 1%. This is already presented in the data when you look back over time and see how many ruckman or key defenders have won the award but I'd still like to see how the numbers play out. 

I'm new to R and Data Science so using this as a practical learning experience. :-)
